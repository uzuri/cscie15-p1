    	<p>I am a web dev at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  I mostly work with Drupal at the moment, though I've done everything from hand-tagging (back in the day) to complex application development.  I have never worked with Laravel, but I'm definitely familiar with PHP (I have to be; Drupal's based on it).</p>
    	
    	<p>I'm taking CSCI E-15 because, while I have years of experience, far too much of that experience is self-taught.  I hope this class will help "spackle over" some of the holes that have developed in my experience (and it's already filled quite a few, so I think this was a good choice).  I also learn by teaching, so I look forward to sharing what I do already know with my classmates through Piazza.</p>
    	
    	<p>I have a BS in Computer Science from Denison University in Granville, OH and am an IT ALM candidate at the Extension School in what should be my second to last semester, if all goes well.</p>
    	
    	<p>These days I'm a Mac user, the last time I touched Windows was XP.  I have using Linux varients in the past.</p>
